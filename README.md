# MusicBucket Web

![github-small](https://github.com/paurieraf/musicbucket/blob/master/images/logos/musicbucket_bot_letter_logo_1229x2574.png?raw=True)

**MusicBucket** is a platform with an API consumed by MusicBucket Bot (https://github.com/paurieraf/musicbucket-bot/)

Its main functionality is to centralize the bot operations and also link the different accounts that an user
can setup to take advantage of all the bot functionalities.

It also allows you to track and manage your bot interactions. 


## Special thanks

- To Pablo I. for the logo.
- To Sergio C. for the deployment operations.
- To the **Sonomada** community and its group in Telegram (https://t.me/Sonomada_gang) where we use and test the bot actively and propose new features.
